description: '"These comments are directed towards educators visiting [this] website
  who might be considering offering, or who might already be teaching, a seminar or
  subject similar to this one.  Since this seminar was an experimental offering with
  a non-standard engineering course format, the instructors thought some explanatory
  comments could be a helpful addition to the syllabus and class notes." (Extracted
  from 16.812 white paper.)

  This document is divided into five sections: Background, Seminar Format, Developing
  Skills for Critical Thinking, Seminar Assessment and Conclusion.'
